#🍻 Climate, Substance Use, and Breweries: A Data Science Exploration
Tools: Python · Pandas · Matplotlib · Seaborn · BeautifulSoup · APIs

📌 Project Overview
This project investigates three research questions using real-world datasets and public APIs:

What are the most common brewery types in San Diego?

Which 5 U.S. states experience the highest summer temperatures?

Which 5 states reported the highest rates of alcohol use disorder (ages 18–25) in 2018?

The project demonstrates proficiency in web scraping, API integration, data wrangling, and data visualization.

🔧 Technologies Used
Python

Pandas for data cleaning and analysis

Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations

BeautifulSoup for web scraping (if used for parsing HTML)

RESTful API from OpenBreweryDB

CSV datasets from CORGIS Dataset Project

📊 Key Insights
Microbreweries and regional breweries dominate the San Diego craft beer scene.

States like Texas and Florida top the list for summer heat, potentially correlating with hydration and alcohol trends.

New Mexico, Montana, and Vermont show disproportionately high rates of alcohol use disorder among youth in 2018.
